To create change, it is not about confronting something head on. It's about telling stories, meeting with people, listening to them, and then try to find a way to reach the heart. One of the greatest challenge in the world, is knowing enough about a subject to think you are right, but now enough about the subject to know you are wrong. Search engines on the internet are the epitome of confirmation bias, and you are gonna use that as evidence that you are correct? No. It is not good enough to be right. We also need to be effective. The more you know, the less you fear. Just listen. Let the silence suck out the truth. Break the rules. Not the law, but the rules.

In fact, the thing I most want to make clear is just how complex it is. In particular, you'll find I spend more time discussing risk and how to limit it than how to achieve invenstment returns. Risk is the most interesting, chanllenging and essential aspect of investing. A philosophy comes from going through life with your eyes open. You must be aware of what's taking place in the world and of what results these events lead to. Only in this way can you put the lessons to work when similar circumstances materialize again. Experience is what you get when you do not get what you want. Good time only tech bad lessons: that investing is easy, that you know its secrets, and that you needn't worry about risk. The most valuable lessons are learned in tough times. 1 Second-leve thinking \u00b6 What is success? Doing better than the market and other investors. All investors cannot beat the market since, collectively, they are the market. Outthink the average You want to do better than average. Thus, you thinking has to be better than that of others: both more powerful and at a higher level. Since other investors may be smart, well-informed and highly computerized, you must find an edge they don't have. You must think of something they have'nt thought of, see things they miss or bring insight they don't possess. You have to react differently and behave differently. Being right may be a necessary condition for investment success, but it won't be sufficient. The problem is that extraordinary performance comes only from correct nonconcensus forecasts , but nonconcensus forcasts are hard to make, hard to make correctly and hard to act on.

Those who consider the investment process simple generally are not aware the need for second level thinking. 2 Market efficiency (and its limitations) \u00b6 The efficient market hypothesis states that information is reflected fully and immediately in the market price of each asset. When I speak of this theory, I also use the word efficient , but I mean it in the sense of \"speady, quick to incorporate information\", but not necessarily \"right\". The most important upshot from the efficient market hypothesis is its conclusion that \"you cannot beat the market\". I have my own reservations about the theory, and the biggest one has to do with the way it links return and risk. The theory says markets will adjust the prices so that the riskier ones will appear to promise higher returns. If riskier investments could be counted on to produce higher returns, they wouldn't be riskier. 20 Reasonable expections \u00b6 Return expectations must be reasonable. Anything else will get you into trouble, usually through the acceptance of greater risk than is perceived. No Investment activity is likely to be successful unless the return goal is explicit and reasonable (in the absolute and relative to the risk entailed).

Through the combination of a real sense of purpose, and an enormous amount of work on behalf of a lot of people, we can make impossible things happen. This class is for anyone who is interested in exploration. Not just exploring space. You'll learn a lot things along the way to space, about yourself, about how to turn yourself into somebody different than you used to be. What it feels like to launch \u00b6 It's an incredible morning to wake up, when you know that this is the day that you're leaving Earth. It's a day that you don't take lightly. It's a day that you've prepared for intensively, your whole life. You start focusing in and thinking about nothing else but the moment that you are in. And you need that. To fly a spaceship, especially a rocket ship, you have to give yourself permission to ignore everything else that exists, just to be ready for all the things that are about to happen. The ship can go bad so quickly, and there are so many things you can do to save the day if you can just be ready enough. Every second going by is a new window of what you're going to do next if something fails. You're hyper ready to react no matter what this machine does, including if it starts to explode underneath you. All of that is in your head. It is an amazing ride. Suddenly, something you have just been dreaming about, something that you never actually let yourself believe what's gonna happen just happened. Now you are in space, but now really it is just the beginning. Leadership; Commanding the ISS (International Space Station) \u00b6 The world has only one space station, and so you take that part very seriously as an astronaut, but even more so when you're the commander of it. You also have the lives of the people onboard, and it is a dangerous place to be. So you have that added responsibility. Not only of the structure, the cost, and the complexity of the ship, but of the health and ultimately the lives of the other five people onboard. It takes a lot more work to be a commander than to be a crew member, but I think it's also more rewarding. It you want to lead properly, you have to know what victory looks like. Create strong relationship through leadership \u00b6 The other crew member are all super competent astronauts. So you can count on good individual decisions almost all the time. The real role of the commander comes in two different times. One is developing, training and building the crew to get ready to launch. The second is if you have a serious problem onboard. I worked with my crew through years in preparation. In fact, it was back in my mind a decade before I became a commander. I would look around the office. I would gonna be in space with some of these people, and I don't know which one they are going to be yet, but let's think about what sort of relationship I should have with everybody? How should I be viewed? What type of traits do I need to develop in myself? Which of these people is a great leader? What are they doing that makes them a good leader? How can I modify myself? How can I be in a position that no matter who I'm chosen with, I'm gonna like them and we are gonna be able to work together and do complicated things? When you get assigned a crew, then you are trying to make sure that the crew is protected, that they get the training that they need, that they feel fulfilled, that they're pursuing their own personal and profession objectives all the way through the training process. The real ultimate test of being a commander is when something goes drastically wrong. You have to respond immediately. You're not the only person involved. There are flight directors or equivalents in Huston, Moscow, Munich, Montreal, Tokyo and etc. All of them have responsibility for the space station, and they are making decisions that affect your lives. You have to be constantly working with all of those other external teams as well. You don't want to wait until you get to orbit to start developing those relationships. You want to start thinking about that way in advance. Understand the people you're working with. Build up the years of mutual understanding, mutual respect and professional competence. Keep preparing, learning and improving \u00b6 You can never prepare too early. You've got to be doing something this afternoon; why not think about stuff that's important to you, that's gonna happen, and get a little readier for it? Leadership is the art of influencing human behavior to accomplish a mission in the manner desired by the leader. The best teacher you can ever have is a bad leader. If the leaders are doing a nice job, you sort of don't even know that they are there. When you see bad leadership, you can learn a lot. I tried to learn all the way along, just in case someday somebody put me in a leadership position. Training and learning: one-pager \u00b6 When you're onboard a spaceship, the amount of information is kind of overwhelming. How do you reset your brain so that the critical information that you needed during that particular activity if fresh? A large part of successfully being an astronaut is learning how to manage information, how to learn things, how to keep things in your brain where you need them. For me the best way to do that, is just initially learn the whole thing, and then boil it down to the part that is your interface. There is big complex theory behind it, but how are you interacting with it. If there is no way for me to interact with it, then it doesn't really matter; it is somebody else's concern, but not mine. Start with the big information, boil out the parts that are really critical to you, and put them on a page so that when you're about to do the job, you can read it, and suddenly it is all there in your head.","title":"Master class"},{"location":"reading/master-class/#master-class","text":"","title":"Master Class"},{"location":"reading/master-class/#space-exploration-by-chris-hadfield","text":"The idea that we could fly wasn't part of normal society.

Start with the big information, boil out the parts that are really critical to you, and put them on a page so that when you're about to do the job, you can read it, and suddenly it is all there in your head.","title":"Training and learning: one-pager"},{"location":"reading/negotiation/","text":"The Art of Negotiation \u00b6 Collaboration \u00b6 The adversary is not the person across the table; the adversary is the situation.

There have been other moments in time that undoubtedly felt very much like the present era. Other entrepreneurs sensed that they were standing on the edge of history, bending authority to their will and reaping fabulous profit along the way. Some of them succeeded beyond their wildest dreams. Many others eventually found themselves caught by a system that bit back and left stranded on what once seemed to be the future. This book tries to yank the Internet out of the spotlight of the 21st century and back to its older and dimmer roots. What their stories show us is that while technology can gravely wound governments, it rarely kills them. Instead, governments survive because, ironically, both society and entrepreneurs want them. Governments provide the property rights that entrepreneurs eventually want, and the legal stability that commerce craves. Consider what happened during the first round of the Information Revolution. Up until the 15th century, information was a tightly controlled commodity. Most of the information then was written and the Catholic Church controlled the writing process. The Church sat at the center of all information flows and essentially performed a quasi-governmental function at that time. In 1453 Gutenberg devised a rudimentary printing press. The technology was rather straightforward, but its implications wreaked slow-boiling havoc on Europe's established social order. The more access people had to printing technologies, the more freedom they had to challenge the Church and to break its monopoly on priestly information. Thus the technology became political. Before too long this radical potential erupted. In 1517 Martin Luther published copies of a list of arguments that directly challenged the Church and its practices. For centuries disgruntled clerics had made similar arguments, but Luther had the technology on his side. Luther's thesis let loose the Reformation and the rise of Protestantism. While the Church undeniably lost the monopoly, they managed to control key forms of information and the power that accompanied them. Rules changed, and power shifted, but the patterns that had dominated before Gutenberg's time remained solidly in place. The book is essentially about frontier stories. It begins with Portuguese voyagers, follows the development of telegraph and radio, and then turns to the advent of satellite television and the Internet. Part of the book's intent is simply to tell these stories, for they are fascinating in their own right. The broader intent, though, is to use these stories to link current developments along the technological frontier back to their rightful ancestors. The stories presented here are all about communication, about bring information from one spot to another. Communication is the sinew of both commerce and politics, the channel through which information -- and thus power and profits -- flows. This is also a book about ideas , about how markets get established and how firms and governments together shape their creation. Business is inherently political and politics has always been marked by the interests of commerce. The overlap is everywhere, but it is particularly strong along the edges of the technological frontier. It is here that markets are actually created, where industries spring to life and then settle eventually into some kind of ordered existence. As this process unwinds, power is distributed and structures are established. In fact, it is precisely the lack of established regulations that makes the technological frontier so political. In order for commerce to grow in any uncharted territory there need to be rules. Without these rules, commerce may still emerge, but it will not flourish. This is a powerful lesson of history and a tragedy that still affects large swaths of the global economy. History provides a sense of perspective that cannot possibly exist in the present; it displays patterns that can appear only once the dust of the frontier has settled and pioneers have moved on. It appears that life along the frontier moves through four distinct phases, each of which has its own rhythm and speed: Phase 1: Innovation. Most of the excitement that surrounds a technology during its earliest days is from enthusiasts, people who treasure innovation simply for what it does, rather than for any commercial potential. Most of other people tend to ignore technological breakthroughs or even disdain them. Phase 2: Commercialization. People now can see how the technology will transfer to a mass market and what kinds of profits can be made from it. Tempted by the dual visions of anarchy and wealth, entrepreneurs of all sorts rush onto the frontier to stake their claims. Speed is essential during this phase, as is a certain ability to see beyond the confines of established business practice. They want to grad \"land\", to stake a claim and call it their own, even if the property rights to this land are not yet fully secure and the commercial prospects are uncertain. Pirates come too, following naturally in the footsteps of the pioneers and often blending in easily with them. Many pioneers are not particularly concerned about ownership. Instead they simply want to attack the frontier as quickly as they can, creating a market before others have had time to arrive. Phase 3: Creative anarchy. The more people who arrive on these frontiers, the harder it becomes for any of them to flourish. The more established pioneers will petition for property rights, seeking to regain the solitude that success demands. Meanwhile, people begin to value standardization over specificity. If the technologies are to develop into a full-fledged markets, they need to develop some set of common standards, some means of coordinating their systems. As the pioneers race into a new market, each armed with his or her own technology and vision of the future, they may actually exacerbate the coordination problem that they desperately need to solve. Frustratingly, the nascent industry is caught by the inevitable struggles of its own success. Phase 4: Rules. Once the pioneers realize the cost of chaos, they begin to lobby for what they once explicitly rejected. Admittedly, it is not always the pioneers who clamor for rules. In general, though, rules get created because private firms want them. In many ways, this book is about rules, about why rules get established along the technological frontier, and who plays the greatest role in their creation.
