<p>Successful investing requires thoughtful attentions to many separate aspects, all at the same time.
Omit any one and the result is likely to be less than satisfactory.
This book is built around the idea of the most important things.</p>
<ul>
<li>It's not my goal to simplify the act of investing. In fact, the thing I most want to make clear is just how complex it is.</li>
<li>In particular, you'll find I spend more time discussing risk and how to limit it than how to achieve invenstment returns. Risk is the most interesting, chanllenging and essential aspect of investing.</li>
<li>A philosophy comes from going through life with your eyes open. You must be aware of what's taking place in the world and of what results these events lead to. Only in this way can you put the lessons to work when similar circumstances materialize again.</li>
<li>Experience is what you get when you do not get what you want.</li>
<li>Good time only tech bad lessons: that investing is easy, that you know its secrets, and that you needn't worry about risk. The most valuable lessons are learned in tough times.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="1-second-leve-thinking">1 Second-leve thinking<a class="headerlink" href="#1-second-leve-thinking" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>What is success? Doing better than the market and other investors. All investors cannot beat the market since, collectively, they are the market.</p>
<details class="note"><summary>Outthink the average</summary><p>You want to do better than average. Thus, you thinking has to be better than that of others: both more powerful and at a higher level.</p>
<ul>
<li>Since other investors may be smart, well-informed and highly computerized, you must find an edge they don't have.</li>
<li>You must think of something they have'nt thought of, see things they miss or bring insight they don't possess.</li>
<li>You have to react differently and behave differently. Being right may be a necessary condition for investment success, but it won't be sufficient.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<p>The problem is that extraordinary performance comes only from <strong>correct nonconcensus forecasts</strong>, but nonconcensus forcasts are hard to make, hard to make correctly and hard to act on.</p>
<details class="note"><summary>Second level thinking is deep, complex and convoluted</summary><ul>
<li>Which outcome do I think will occur?</li>
<li>What does concensus think?</li>
<li>How does my expectation differ from the consensus?</li>
<li>What will happen if the concensus turns out to be right, and what if I am right?</li>
</ul>
</details>
<p>Those who consider the investment process simple generally are not aware the need for second level thinking.</p>
<h2 id="2-market-efficiency-and-its-limitations">2 Market efficiency (and its limitations)<a class="headerlink" href="#2-market-efficiency-and-its-limitations" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The efficient market hypothesis states that information is reflected fully and immediately in the market price of each asset.</li>
<li>When I speak of this theory, I also use the word <strong>efficient</strong>, but I mean it in the sense of "speady, quick to incorporate information", but not necessarily "right".</li>
<li>The most important upshot from the efficient market hypothesis is its conclusion that "you cannot beat the market".</li>
<li>I have my own reservations about the theory, and the biggest one has to do with the way it links return and risk. The theory says markets will adjust the prices so that the riskier ones will appear to promise higher returns. If riskier investments could be counted on to produce higher returns, they wouldn't be riskier.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="20-reasonable-expections">20 Reasonable expections<a class="headerlink" href="#20-reasonable-expections" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Return expectations must be reasonable.
Anything else will get you into trouble, usually through the acceptance of greater risk than is perceived.</p>
<p>No Investment activity is likely to be successful unless the return goal is <strong>explicit</strong> and <strong>reasonable</strong> (in the absolute and relative to the risk entailed).</p>
<details class="note"><summary>Every investment effort should begin with a statement of what you are trying to accomplish</summary><ul>
<li>What your return goal is</li>
<li>How much risk you can tolerate</li>
<li>How much liquidity you are likely to require in the interim</li>
</ul>
